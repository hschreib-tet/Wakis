        Regression test for PEC boundary masking.

        WAKIS stores only Nx*Ny*Nz DOFs per field component.
        Therefore, tangential E-field DOFs exist explicitly on the
        low-side boundaries, but not on the high-side boundaries.

        Low-side PEC boundaries must mask the corresponding stored
        tangential E-field DOFs.
